This script helps with grading on Gradescope. In particular, it helps graders who like grading one question at a time 
for all their students, rather than grading the entire problem set for one student at a time. 

This script opens a new tab in your browser with each student's submission for a specific question. For example, when
beginning to grade question 1, run this script and you will get each student you need to grade's answer to question
1 in a new tab.

This script harnesses the power of computer science, big data analytics, machine learning, and Bayes' theorem to 
hopefully save a few seconds in your life.

Instructions for running the script are in gradescope.js.

Note:
If you try this script and nothing happens, you might need to enable popups in your browser settings.
